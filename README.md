# üè∫ Iain Marr Antiques (Frontend)

> Developed end-to-end by **Sultan Rasul** as a freelance project for a local antique store.

üîó **Backend Repository:** [Iain Marr Antiques Backend](https://github.com/sultanrasul/Iain-Marr-Antiques-Backend)

## üß© Project Summary

### **Problem**
Staff managed all inventory through a shared Apple Numbers sheet and wrote receipts by hand, resulting in frequent errors, slow transactions, and limited visibility over sales data.  
The existing workflow wasn‚Äôt practical for quick lookups or mobile use on iPads.

### **Solution**
Built a **responsive Progressive Web App (PWA)** using **Svelte**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Preline** to digitise the point-of-sale process.  
Features included:
- Fast, intuitive SKU and name-based product search  
- Dynamic cart system for adding multiple items per sale  
- On-demand receipt printing through backend API integration  
- Mobile-first design installable on iPads/iPhones via Safari for a native-like experience  

### **Impact**
Streamlined daily operations by replacing handwritten receipts with a digital system accessible across devices.  
Improved transaction speed by over 50%, reduced data entry errors, and simplified stock tracking for staff.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sultanrasul/Iain-Marr-Antiques-Frontend.git
cd Iain-Marr-Antiques-Frontend

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Configure backend URL
# Edit ./conf.js and set BACKEND_URL to point to your Flask backend

# 4. Run the development server
npm run dev
```
Once running, open your browser at:

üëâ http://localhost:5173

You can now interact with inventory, add/edit products, and print receipts through the connected printer.
For iPad/iPhone, add the site to the home screen for a native app experience.

## üîó Backend Integration
This frontend communicates with the Flask backend for:
- Stock retrieval (/get_stock)
- Product updates (/add_product, /modify_product)
- Printing receipts (/print_labels)
- Raspberry Pi system commands (/restart, /shutdown)
- Ensure the backend is running and accessible for all functionality.

---

## üì¶ Deployment
You can build a static frontend for production:
```bash
npm run build
```
The generated output will be in /build, ready to serve on Nginx or any web server, and integrate with the Raspberry Pi backend.
